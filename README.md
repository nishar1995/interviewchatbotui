# Obtaining API Keys

Before running the project, you need to obtain the following API keys from third-party services:

### OpenAI API Key:

Obtain your OpenAI API key from the OpenAI website.

### Zoom SDK Key and Secret:

Obtain your Zoom SDK key and secret from the Zoom Developer website.

Once you have obtained these API keys, you need to set them as environment variables in your system or in a .env file. Here's how you can do it:

Create a .env file in the root directory of your project.

Add the following lines to the .env file:

```
PORT=8000
DEBUG=True
ZOOM_MEETING_SDK_KEY=" your ZOOM_MEETING_SDK_KEY"
ZOOM_MEETING_SDK_SECRET="your ZOOM_MEETING_SDK_SECRET"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your OPENAI_API_KEY"
```
Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys. These environment variables will be read by the Django application during runtime.
