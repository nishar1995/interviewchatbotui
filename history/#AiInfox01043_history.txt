Question: Describe the differences between dynamic typing and static typing in programming languages. Provide examples of languages that use each approach and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each.
Answer: kya dynamic typing is when you can easily you know interchange the variable types you can assign any value but the street typing is when you need to stick to 1 particular type for example types script is a strict typing but in Python or JavaScript you can actually assignment number or string different

Question: Can you explain the difference between Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing? How do they impact the decision-making process?
Answer: sudizer basically false positive and first negative kind of errors so there is a box which actually makes a we need to set some P value in order to detect that and this yeah crucial for the decision making process
